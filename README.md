# Marketplace

An online shopping website where users can post, edit, delete, and buy products. It is inspire by applications such as OfferUp and VarageSale. I uses Bootstrap 5 and sass for styling and NodeJS, Express, and MongooseJS for the backend and MongoDB for the database.

I implemented this REST API to handle the storage functionality:
